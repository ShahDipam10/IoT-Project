# IoT-Project
Purpose:
 Finding a car parking space is a big issue in congested cities. There are too many vehicles on the road but not enough parking spaces. One of the biggest problems is when we enter a parking area then we realize      that there are no empty parking slots to park our cars. Another problem is after entering in a parking area we confused to find the empty parking slot to park our car. We all had faced these problems that wasted     our time. That’s why we need efficient parking management systems in all parking areas that will provide confusion-free and easy parking.

Working:
 The IR sensor at the entrance detects a coming car and will automatically showcases that there is a free slot in the parking lot but if the lot is full, then it’ll show empty space. When a vehicle leaves a slot and  arrives at the gate of the parking area then the IR sensor-2 detects that vehicle and the system open the servo barrier. Then it shows that the slot is empty. Again the system will allow entering a new vehicle. IR   Sensor will transmit the data to Arduino Board and further it will pass the data to USER through NodeMCU.
